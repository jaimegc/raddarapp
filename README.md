# Raddar
Raddar is the first social app where your posts could die. Your post could die or can be leaders of the world ranking. Swipe up or swipe down every post you find in your Raddar. Your votes and the votes of the entire community will decide if the posts survive or die forever.

This app was the product of a Startup from Seville (Spain) called Kreomi that did not work in the market. We made this application in our free time after work. We started in 2016 and finished in 2018.

    This project is deprecated
    We do not save any data, all data are mocks

## Others

* Project
  * <b><u>VERY IMPORTANT</u>: To launch this project, use the "debugFake" Build Variant</b>
  * This project is a <b>Beta</b>, some features are not implemented. For example, edit a publication, follow users, delete comments, report a publication and so on
  * This project is <b>deprecated</b>, we started in 2016 and we have not tested devices with Android >= 8.0
  * Tests are incompleted. There are some deprecated instrumentation tests with MockWebServer
  * The idea of the empty interfaces, packages organization, all the Activities with a Fragment and so on, was to homogenize the development for the backend developers. So, they could develop new features easily
  * We ‚ù§Ô∏è Kotlin but in this old project we used Java üò≠
  * We ‚ù§Ô∏è testing but for this product made in our free time after work... Sorry! üôè Moreover, you will see later a lot of changes in previous versions of Raddar, so create a new test each week it did not make sense üòÖ
  * We ‚ù§Ô∏è Clean Code & Clean Architecture but it is not always possible. Be pragmatic! ‚úåÔ∏è
